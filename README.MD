# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and interactive way to understand how sorting algorithms work.

## Purpose

I created this sorting visualizer to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while providing beginners in programming with a tool to better understand sorting algorithms through visualization. By observing how these algorithms sort data, users can gain insights into their workings and performance.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

This application supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
3. **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
4. **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.
5. **Quick Sort**: Selects a 'pivot' element, partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

## Features

- Visualizes the step-by-step process of each sorting algorithm.
- Allows users to control the speed of the sorting process.
- Provides an interactive interface to test different array sizes and values.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and animations.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enjoy visualizing different sorting algorithms!
